There is an issue trying to obtain GPS info from the device and it is hoped that In future a future firmware update will allow us to grab an echo of GPS info. In the mean time workarounds are being sought:

Attempt 1: [FAILED] : As the Teensy Tracker doesn't echo GPS in firmware the route to display data is ;

Press SEND GPS button

ESC %A1 #Turns of APRS
ESC %AI #Queries GPS string
Parses #Program parses out the GPS position part
ESC %A0 #Turns off APRS to prevent APRS beacons in the chat program
ESC %ZS #Saves the APRS off condition

Attempt 2: 

trying the above but instead of attempting a parse, attempting to have aprs position string appear in the send field.

When pressing GPS SEND 
1. A pre check of all APRS conditions required for obtaining APRS position string e.g GPS fix, I to confirm global Mycall,

%AM to read APRS-Mycall, %A to show mode, %AV to read validity window, %AI to show GPS status/age,

2. When pre-requisites are true, then we may get string output and work from there

Success!
