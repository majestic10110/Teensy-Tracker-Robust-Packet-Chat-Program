Robust Chat 1.3.9.c 

Important: to utilize fleet manager and persistent messages (retained message memory on reboot for emcom logs) you require the following in same folder as the Robust Chat program:

Fleetlist.json (generated automatically by program on first boot)
Extract 'Store_with Messages file' , this will give a folder called 'Store' in the same folder as your Robust Chat program. In the store folder is the Messages.json 

After 1.3.9.c this should auto install the folders in same folder , if not after first boot, then add manual



Has Fleet management i.e white list ability

You will be required to enter a base callsign without SSID and add another with a hyphen asterix to cover 1-99 SSID for example G4ABC:

Add G4ABC
Add G4ABC-*
