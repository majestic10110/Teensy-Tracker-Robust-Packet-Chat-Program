1. Install Python

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Download Python 3.10 or newer (64-bit).

During installation:

✅ Tick “Add Python to PATH” (important).

Then click Install Now.

2. Install Dependencies

Open the Command Prompt (press ⊞ Win → type cmd → press Enter).

Type this command and press Enter:

pip install pyqt5 pyserial


This will install the graphical toolkit (PyQt5) and serial communication library (pyserial).

3. Get the Program

Put the file Teensy_Tracker_Chat_v0958.py into a folder (e.g. C:\TeensyTracker).

You can download and move it there.

4. Run the Program

Open Command Prompt again.

Change to the folder where the file is saved. Example:

cd C:\TeensyTracker


Start the program by typing:

python Teensy_Tracker_Chat_v0958.py

5. Using the Program

The window will open with:

Serial settings at the top (choose your COM port and baud rate, then click Connect).

Chat tab with send/receive windows and a red SEND button.

Send GPS button (top-right) to send your current GPS coordinates.

Grid Map tab to see positions plotted.

⚠️ Tips for beginners (You can always use www.Grok.com or www.ChatGPT.com to help with any issues you have getting started.)

If you get an error like “python not found”, restart your computer (PATH change takes effect).

If that doesn’t work, run py instead of python. Example:

py Teensy_Tracker_Chat_v0958.py


Make sure your Teensy or TNC device is plugged in and shows up in Windows Device Manager as a COM port.
